# Trading-Buddy

Trading-Buddy is a minimalistic web-client for BingX crypto exchange Peprpetual Futures trading that allows for automatic:
- Posistion size calculation based on data for available deposit, risk(%) and available margin on your futures account
- Limit/take-profit/stop-loss orders placement and cancelation
- Track of your trades in Trade Journal

# Setup
Trading-Buddy comes with complete Dockerfile that should be used to build your image and deployed to VPS, personally I am using [Digital Ocean](digitalocean.com)
